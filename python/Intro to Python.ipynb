    "    - Python is used for the following:\n",
    "        * Sofatware Development\n",
    "        * Mathmatics\n",
    "        * System Scriptng \n",

    "   ## What Can Python Do?\n",
    "       - Python can be used to make web applications\n",
    "       - Python can be used alongside software to create workflows\n",
    "       - Python can connect to database systems. It can also modify files\n",
    "       - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathmatics\n",
    "       - Python can be used for for rapid prototyping, or for production ready software development\n",
    "       \n",
    "   ## Why Python?\n",
    "       - Python works on most platforms\n",
    "       - Pyhton runs on an interpreter system, which means the code can be executed as soon as possible\n",
    "       - Python can be used in a procedural way, object oriented way or a functional way \n",
    "       \n",
    "   ## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "       - Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the english language with some influences from mathmatics\n",
    "       - Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "       - Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.\n",
